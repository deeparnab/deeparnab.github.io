\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Prove: for any two random variables $X,Y$, $\Exp[X+Y] = \Exp[X] + \Exp[Y]$.
\item[(b)]
Prove or disprove: for independent random variables $X,Y$, \mbox{$\Var[XY] = \Var[X]\cdot \Var[Y]$.}
%\item[(b)] Prove or disprove: for any two random variables $X$ and $Y$ (not necessarily independent), \\ $\Exp[XY] \leq \sqrt{\Exp[X^2]}\sqrt{\Exp[Y^2]}$.
%\item[(b)]Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables (not necessarily independent), and let $E(X,Y)$ be an event. Suppose $\Pr_{X,Y}[E(X,Y)] \geq \beta$. Then, show that $\Pr_X[\Pr_Y[E(X,Y)] \geq \beta/2] \geq \beta/2$.  

\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.5ex}

\item 
Consider a set system where each set has exactly $10$ elements and every element is present in exactly $10$ sets. 
Can you colour the elements red or blue such that every set has elements of both colours?
%
%\item A hypergraph is $k$-uniform if each hyperedge has exactly $k$ vertices, and is called
%$k$-regular if every vertex is in exactly $k$ different hyperedges. A hypergraph is $2$-colorable if every vertex can be coloured either red or blue such that there are no monochromatic hyperedges. Prove that for $k>10$, every $k$-uniform, $k$-regular hypergraph is $2$-colourable.
\vspace{0.5ex}

\item Consider the random graph $G_{n,p}$ when $p = cn^{-2/3}$, and let $X$ be the number of $4$-cliques in the graph. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  What is $\Exp[X]$?
	\item  What is an upper bound on $\Var[X]$?
	\item  What is $\lim_{n\to \infty} \Pr[X = 0]$? 
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.5ex}

%\item Prove that for any two random variables $X$ and $Y$ (not necessarily independent), \\ $\Exp[XY] \leq \sqrt{\Exp[X^2]}\sqrt{\Exp[Y^2]}$.
%Assume $X$ and $Y$ are discrete.
%\item 
%$X$ is a random variable with expectation $\mu > 0$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. 
%Prove $\Pr[X > 0] \geq \frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2 + \mu^2}$. You are allowed to use the statement from the previous question without proof.
%\vspace{0.5ex}
%\item Define  $S_n := |X_1 + \cdots + X_n|$ where each $X_i$'s are independent random variables which are  $\pm 1$ with probability $1/2$.
%Prove $\Exp[S_n] = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$.
%\vspace{0.5ex}
\item
Suppose you can draw independent samples of a real random variable $X$ that has expectation $0$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. Explain how to use only $O(\log n)$ samples from this source to generate a random variable $Y$ with expectation $\mu$ such that $\Pr[|Y-\mu| > 2 \sigma] < 1/n$. 
\vspace{0.5ex}
\item 
Consider the following algorithm for the independent set problem on an $n$-node graph. Sample a random permutation $\sigma$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Initialize $I$ to $\emptyset$.
For $i=1$ to $n$, place $\sigma(i)$ in $I$ if it doesn't have an edge to any vertex in $I$.  In expectation, how large an independent set do you pick?
\vspace{0.5ex}




\item  In $d$-dimensions, there can be at most $d$ unit vectors which are orthogonal to each other.
Call a pair of unit vectors $\eps$-orthogonal if $|u^\top v|\leq \eps$. How large (in cardinality) a set of pairwise $\eps$-orthogonal unit vectors can you construct in $d$-dimensions?
