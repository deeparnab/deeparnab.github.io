<p><b> Background Assumed: </b><br>
Students should have basic knowledge about programming <i> and </i> should be able to read and write math proofs.  
If you have taken CS 1, CS 10, and CS 30, you should be fine. In case you haven't, then please see the instructor.
See <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~deepc/Courses/W19/lecs/TLDR.pdf"> this </a> for what I teach in CS30.

<center> <b> Course Methodology  </b>  </center><br> 

CS 31, Winter 2021 will be <b> remote, synchronous</b>. All students are expected to attend lectures, although videos of the lectures will be made available
on Canvas. Preliminary notes will be available <b> before </b> most lectures, and it may be useful to read them beforehand. <br>
<br>

We will have <b>many</b> types of deliverables. 

<ul>
<li> <b> Drills. </b> For almost every lecture note, I will have a corresponding drill. These are supposed to be "simple" questions which check if you are following the material you are consuming. These will often be Canvas Quizzes. </li>
<li> <b> Coding Assignments. </b> Every week, I will post a coding assignment which will mostly involve you implementing one or two of the algorithms we learn in the course. This will allow you to move from the abstract to the concrete. </li>
<li> <b> Problem Set. </b> Every week, you will be given two problems to do. Almost always, these will have subproblems. Doing these problems is where the *real* learning will take place. </li>
<li> <b> Advanced Problem Set. </b> Every week, I will also give one more advanced problem. This should be attempted after you have satisfactorily finished the problem set problems. </li>
</ul>
Apart from this, I will also provide, bunch of <i> ungraded practice problems </i>.
These are not for submission, but doing all these is what will make you a top-notch algorithmist. <br>

<p>
<b> Text Books </b> 
<br>
There is <b> no required </b> textbook. 
However, the material is mostly going to be from the following two books, and I will give pointers to them as well if needed.
<ul>
<li> (DPV) <i> Algorithms </i> by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani </li>
<li> (CLRS) <i> Introduction to Algorithms </i> by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein </li>
</li>
</ul>
Students <i> don't </i> have to buy any of the above books. Indeed, if you Google, you may find pdf copies on the web.
You are, however, <b> not allowed </b> to look at or refer to the solutions manuals for these books.


<p><b> Grading </b> <br>
Below is a distribution of how the grades will be decided.
<ul>
<li> Drills: 10% </li>
<li> Coding Assignments: 15% </li>
<li> Weekly Problem Sets : 30% </li>
<li> Advanced Problem Sets : 5% </li>
<li> Take Home Test 1 : 20% </li>
<li> Take Home Test 2 : 20% </li>
</ul>
Final letter grades are curved. Here are some sufficient conditions: if you get more than 60%, you will pass.
If you get more than 93%, you will get an A. My tests are usually hard; medians can be close to 70%.

<br>
<a name="policies"></a>
<center> <b> Policies </b>  </center>
<p> 
<b> Evaluation Policies : Details</b>
<ul>

<li> <i> Lateness Policy. </i> You are <b> not </b> allowed to be late. All timestamps will be based on what Canvas says. 
For coding assignments and weekly psets, you will be given a <b>bonus +1</b> point (but capped at 100%) if you are more than 24 hours early. 
We are aware that sometimes stuff comes in the way, especially during these uncertain times, and that is why we will have *slack*.
<br><br></li>



<li> <i> Slack. </i>  There is 10% slack on the drills, coding assignments, and weekly problem sets.
What this means is that at the end of the course, whatever percentage you obtain in each of these sections, will be multiplied by 100/90, capping at 100%. 
Apart from releasing some stress, this slack also takes care of discrepancies in grading by various TAs. There will be no slack on the advanced psets. <br><br></li>

<li> <i> Tests. </i> There will be two tests. You will get 24-36 hours to complete, and you are allowed access to the class materials (notes, videos, solutions, etc).
Work will be completely on your own.
The 24-36 hour period does <b> not </b> mean it is going to need this much time; indeed, the test should be do-able under 3-4 hours. <br><br>

<li> <i> Focus on learning and fun. </i> I hope that all of you will make the best of this situation and actually learn this beautiful subject. 
<b>Please have fun</b>. Algorithms are indeed difficult to master, and the barrage of problems that I provide from my end (although only a few are for credit) may feel stressful.
Please don't be stressed. Algorithms, it is good to remember, are not the most important thing in life. 

</ul>



<p>
<b> Regrading Policy</b><br>
<br>

If you feel a grader has not graded accurately, then please contact them via email <b>cc-ing the head TA</b>.
If even after this you feel unsatisfied, then you can email the instructor for a <u> full regrade </u>. 
I will look at the entire problem set and re-grade it completely. Note: this has to be done within <b> 2 weeks </b> of the solution being released.
Also, remember, the slack available though before you exercise regrading.




<p>
<b> Zoom Etiquette</b><br>
<br>

I am sure we will all learn various etiquettes on the fly (and I will keep posting them).
But a few standard things.
<ul>
<li> Please try to be completely engaged when attending a Zoom lecture or Zoom office hours. 
<li> Please keep your video ON if you can, especially during office hours. 
<li> Please keep your microphone "muted" when not speaking. 
<li> Please be polite and kind to everyone. 
</ul>


<p>
<b> Academic Integrity / Honor Code </b><br>
<br>

Algorithms are tough, but fun. And it is even more fun when one works with a friend. <b> I highly recommend forming study groups </b> and watching videos together, going over notes together, pore over practice problems + solutions together.
And bang heads on the weekly problem set together. This is not only allowed, I highly encourage it. However, the final solution you write, <b> must be your own.</b> <br> <br>

For coding assignments and drills, I recommend <b>working on your own</b>. This will make you understand the concepts better, and make you all better coders.
Only if stuck, contact the teaching personnel or your friend. For instance, if your code is not working, this is the perfect thing to share your screen with a TA and ask them what's wrong.
Or asking your friend, <i>"Hey, how does one convert a string to an integer in Python?"</i> Perfectly OK. But there is a line here which you must make sure you don't cross. <br><br>

<font color="red"> <b> This is important </b> : </font> For <b>all</b> your submissions, you <b> must </b> provide a credit statment even if you have worked alone (in which case, state "Worked alone").
Please write the names of all you have worked with. If this set is empty say so. Not writing a credit statement <b> can give you a zero </b>.
I know many solutions are written at the last minute; spend the first 10 seconds of that minute to 
cite people who help you. Good habit. <br> <br>

Finally, some <b> possible honor principle violations </b> to be aware of in this online course offering.
<ul>
<li>Sharing the same overleaf, github, replit, etc website for sharing any part of the (drill, coding, weekly pset) assignments. You simply cannot share this. </li>
<li> Obtaining answers on the Web, and then simply copy-and-pasting. Especially pertains to coding assignments. </li>
</ul>
I stress here that since you all will be "socially distant", you will probably using tools like above to brainstorm, etc. 
For instance, you may zoom with a classmate about a pset, and then you may obtain (say in a recorded session) some written material from your friend about a weekly pset.
You <b>must not</b> use it as is; everything you write must be your own words. <br><br>

Simply put, there is a line, and you would know if you are crossing it. Just don't. 
Dartmouth's Academic Honor Principle applies to this course. Please be sure to read the principle, which you can 
find <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/judicialaffairs/honor/"> here </a>.
Please ask me if you have any questions about the honor code as it applies to CS 31. Please, please don't be in a situation where you and I need to go through unpleasantries. <br>
