<b> Course Description and Goals: </b> <br>
Discrete Mathematics is what one needs to talk about most problems in computer science which involves discrete objects such as bits, integers, files in a directory, 
nodes in a network, etc. At the end of this course, students will be comfortable understanding and using this language. 
The other main objective is to read, write, and understand <i> rigorous mathematical proofs </i> of propositions involving these discrete objects.


<p><b> Background Assumed: </b><br>
Students should have basic knowledge about programming (CS1) <i> and </i> should have some familiarity with basic math.
You should know the concepts given <a href="./lecs/lec0.pdf"> here </a>.
<hr> 
<br>
<b> Class Times:</b> 10 (MWF: 10:10am - 11:15am), X-hours (Th: 12:15pm - 1:05pm) <br> 
<b> Venue: </b> TBD <br> 
<b> Discussions: </b> Piazza (via Canvas) <br>
<b> Problem Sets: </b> Canvas <br>

<p>
<b> Text Book </b> <br>
I will post lecture notes for every class. No text is required. However, the course will loosely follow a text by
David Liben-Nowell, <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yafoe4yn"> Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science</a>. <i> It is not necessary to buy this text </i>

<p><b> Evaluation </b> 
<ul>
<li> Drill Exercises: 30% </li>
<li> Problem Sets : 24% </li>
<li> Midterm : 12 + 12% </li>
<li> Final : 21% </li>
<li> Participation : 1% </li>
</ul>
After <b> almost every </b> class there will be a drill exercise of 1 or 2 problems with a 36 hour deadline.
There will be weekly problem sets. There will be two Midterms and one Final. These are in-class and closed-book. <br>

<p><b> Collaboration </b><br>
I highly recommend forming work groups of two or three to work on the weekly problem sets, and also going over the material.
<i> Your final submission <b>must</b> be your own words and <b>must</b> acknowledge who you discussed with. </i>
You are <b> not allowed </b> to discuss the drills at all.

<!--
<p> <b> Tentative Topics Covered: </b> Big Oh Notation, Divide and Conquer Algorithms, Randomized Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, 
Graph Traversal, Shortest Path, Maximum Flow Problems, Matching. <br>
 Detailed schedule will be available when the class starts. -->

<h2> Tentative Weekly Schedule </h2> 

Anything after today's date is tentative. 
As seen below (marked in bold), we will be utilizing our X-hours a lot. 
The fourth column is a reference to the text above -- once again, that is only added reading, and the text is not necessary.

<h2> Policies  </h2>

<p>
<b> Attendance </b><br>
Attend <b> all </b> classes including X-hours, of which I may use all of.



<p>
<b> Regrading Policy</b><br>
If you feel that the grader has not graded accurately then you should compose an email clearly writing down which problem <u> and </u> your reason 
why you think the grading is 
incorrect, and email it to the relevant TA <b> cc-ing the head TA </b>. If you are unsatisfied by the grader's response, get back to the head TA. 
If even after all this you feel unsatisfied, then you can email the instructor for a <u> full regrade </u>.
I will look at the entire problem set and re-grade it completely.



<p>
<b> Lateness Policy </b><br>
You are <b> not </b> allowed any late submissions under any circumstances. This is for logistic reasons so that I can release solutions and  get grading done on time.
I fully understand that unforeseen circumstances may occur. For this reason, there will be a buffer of 12%. This is designed so that on the weekly problem sets you can still
get 100% even if you <i> completely miss </i> handing in one. <br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Furthermore, on the weekly problem sets, if you hand in <b> one day early </b>, then you get a <b> bonus </b> of one point (you can never get more than 100% though). <br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
All timestamps will be based on what Canvas says. Please do not email us saying Canvas did not upload properly, etc; email Canvas instead.


<p>
<b> Timing Conflicts </b><br>
There are two in-class midterms (30th Jan and 20th Feb) during the evenings. 
If you cannot be present for these, you need to consult your undergraduate dean regarding your reason and have them email me about it.
I may make an adjustment if the reason sounds valid. For example, going to a concert is not a valid reason, even if you are in the band.


<p>
<b> Laptops and Phone Policy </b><br>
We encourage students not to use devices in class. If they have to, then they need to seat themselves on the fringes of the classroom 
so as to not distract other students. <br>



<p>
<b> Academic Integrity / Honor Code </b><br>
<u> All work submitted for credit must be your own.</u> 
This means what you put down on paper for submission cannot be in any way copied from a black/white board, a computer screen, or even your notes from class.
<br>

You <b> cannot </b> discuss the drill problem sets with anyone. 
You may discuss the problem sets with your classmates (taking the course with you), the TAs, and the instructor. No one else. 
You are also not allowed to give away solutions to your classmates.
Clarification questions about problems should be asked on Piazza. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
At the beginning of each problem you must write who you discussed with, and what way did the person help you or you help them. <b> This is important </b>.
If you did not talk with anyone about any of the problems, mention this at the beginning of the homework.
Any written sources used (apart from the text, your lecture notes and any homework solutions that I distribute) must also be acknowledged; 
however, you may not consult any solutions on the Internet or from previous years' assignments, whether they are student- or faculty-generated. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Dartmouth's Academic Honor Principle applies to this course. Please be sure to read the principle, which you can find <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/judicialaffairs/honor/"> here </a>.
Please ask me if you have any questions about the honor code as it applies to CS 30. Better safe than sorry!

<p> <b> Student Accessibility Needs </b><br>

Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to see me privately as early in the term as possible. 
Students requiring disability-related academic adjustments and services must consult the Student Accessibility Services office (Carson Hall, Suite 125, 646-9900). 
Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to their professor. 
As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.

<p>
<b> Mental Health </b><br>

The academic environment at Dartmouth is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life. 
There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including your undergraduate dean (http://www.dartmouth.edu/~upperde/), 
Counseling and Human Development (http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chd/), and the Student Wellness Center (http://www.dartmouth.edu/~healthed/).


<p>
<b> Religious Observances </b><br>

Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. 
If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
