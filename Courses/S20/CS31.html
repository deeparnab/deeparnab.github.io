<b> Course Description and Goals: </b> <br>
Algorithms are step-by-step instructions for a computation problem. 
Although this sounds like a cooking recipe, good algorithms is what makes the modern world run.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  In this course, we will study algorithms rigorously. At the end of the course, the student should be able to 
<u>design</u> algorithms for problems, <u>reason</u> about these algorithms, and <u>communicate</u> the algorithm and its analysis.


<p><b> Background Assumed: </b><br>
Students should have basic knowledge about programming <i> and </i> should be able to read and write math proofs.  
If you have taken CS 1, CS 10, and CS 30, you should be fine. In case you haven't, then please see the instructor.
See <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~deepc/Courses/W19/lecs/TLDR.pdf"> this </a> for what I teach in CS30.

<br>
<center> <b> Course Methodology  </b>  </center><br> 

CS 31, Spring 2020 will be offered <b> online</b>. Almost all information will be available via the Canvas page.
The course will be sort-of-flipped. We will post material (videos and notes) beforehand, and these will be the primary sources of your knowledge.
On the usual class hours (the 2A hour), we will discuss some pre-determined material over zoom, which you will be <b>expected to go through beforehand</b>.
I envision this discussion to be (a) a quick summary from my end, (b) addressing questions and clarifications, and (c) if time permits, perhaps see an application problem pertaining to the material.
A schedule of this will also be posted very soon on the class webpage. <br>
<br>


To see you have learnt the material, we will have <b>three</b> types of deliverables. 

<ul>
<li> <b> Drills. </b> For almost every lecture note, I will have a corresponding drill. These are supposed to be "simple" questions which check if you are following the material you are consuming.  </li>
<li> <b> Coding Assignments. </b> Every week, I will post a coding assignment which will mostly involve you implementing one or two of the algorithms we learn in the course. This will allow you to move from the abstract to the concrete. </li>
<li> <b> Problem Set. </b> Every week, you will be given two problems to do. Almost always, these will have subproblems. Doing these problems is where the *real* learning will take place. </li>
</ul>
Apart from this, I will also provide, every week, one <i> advanced problem </i>, bunch of <i> ungraded practice problems </i>, and some creative <i> reduction-style </i> problems.
These are not for submission, but doing all these is what will make a top-notch algorithmist. <br>

<b> Videos and Notes : </b> Canvas (under construction) <br>

<b> Live Class Times :</b> 2A (TR: 2:25pm - 4:15pm)  <br> 

<b> Venue : </b> Zoom (meeting id and password in email) <br> 

<b> Discussions : </b>  Piazza (via Canvas) <br>

<b> Drills, Coding, PSets : </b> All submissions via Canvas <br>

<b> Personnel :</b> 
<ul>
<li> <a style="color:inherit" href="./../../index.htm"> Deeparnab Chakrabarty</a> (Instructor) </li>
<li> Maryam Negahbani (Head TA) </li> 
<li> Anup Joshi (TA)  </li>
<li> Themis Haris (TA)  </li>
<li> Sarah Hong (TA) </li>
<li> Runze Liu (TA) </li>
<li> Alex Quill (TA)  </li>
<li> Linda Xiao (TA) </li> 
</ul>
Office hours will be posted on Canvas with Zoom links.
<p>
<b> Text Books </b> 
<br>
There is <b> no required </b> textbook. 
However, the material is mostly going to be from the following two books, and I will give pointers to them as well if needed.
<ul>
<li> (DPV) <i> Algorithms </i> by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani </li>
<li> (CLRS) <i> Introduction to Algorithms </i> by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein </li>
</li>
</ul>
Students <i> don't </i> have to buy any of the above books. Indeed, if you Google, you may find pdf copies on the web.
You are, however, <b> not allowed </b> to look at or refer to the solutions manuals for these books.


<p><b> Grading </b> <br>
As you all know, this term every student will be getting a (CT/NC) grade. Below is the distribution of points.
<ul>
<li> Drills: 15% </li>
<li> Coding Assignments: 25% </li>
<li> Weekly Problem Sets : 30% </li>
<li> Take Home Test 1 : 15% </li>
<li> Take Home Test 2 : 15% </li>
</ul>
If you get more than 60% in the course, you will get an CT. 
This is a <i> sufficient </i> condition, not a <i> necessary </i> one.
If you do well in this course, you will get a citation.<br>
<br>

<a name="policies"></a>
<center> <b> Policies </b>  </center>
<p> 
<b> Evaluation Policies : Details</b>
<ul>

<li> <i> Lateness Policy. </i> You are <b> not </b> allowed to be late. All timestamps will be based on what Canvas says. 
However, for coding assignments and weekly psets, you will be given a <b>bonus +1</b> point if you are more than 24 hours early. 
We are aware that sometimes stuff comes in the way, especially during these uncertain times, and that is why we will have *slack* for drills, coding assignments, and weekly psets.
<br><br></li>



<li> <i> Slack. </i>  There is 15% slack on all deliverables. What this means is that at the end of the course, whatever percentage you obtain in each of these sections, will be multiplied by 100/85, capping at 100%. 
So, if you get 90% on the Drills, 85% on the Coding assignmnets, and 80% on the Psets, your final score will be 100% on the drills, 100% on the Coding assignments, and 94.12% on the Psets. 
Apart from releasing some stress, this slack also takes care of discrepancies in grading by various TAs. <br><br></li>

<li> <i> Tests. </i> There will be two tests. Ideally, these would be in-class, closed-book, 3 hour tests. But this time, I will make them 24-36 hours long, open-notes (but no web), no-discussion, test.
The extended time does <b> not </b> mean it is going to need this much time; indeed, the test should be do-able under 3-4 hours. <br><br>

<li> <i> Focus on learning and fun. </i> I hope that all of you will make the best of this situation and actually learn this beautiful subject. 
<b>Please have fun</b>. Algorithms are indeed difficult to master, and the barrage of problems that I provide from my end (although only a few are for credit) may feel stressful.
Please don't be stressed. Algorithms, it is good to remember, are not the most important thing in life. 

</ul>



<p>
<b> Regrading Policy</b><br>
<br>

If you feel a grader has not graded accurately, then please contact them via email <b>cc-ing the head TA</b> (Maryam). 
If even after this you feel unsatisfied, then you can email the instructor for a <u> full regrade </u>. 
I will look at the entire problem set and re-grade it completely. Note: this has to be done within <b> 2 weeks </b> of you being handed the solution. 
Also, remember, the slack available though before you exercise regrading.




<p>
<b> Zoom Etiquette</b><br>
<br>

I am sure we will all learn various etiquettes on the fly (and I will keep posting them).
But a few standard things.
<ul>
<li> Please try to be completely engaged when attending a Zoom lecture or Zoom office hours.
<li> Please keep your microphone and camera "muted" when not using. I know this tends to decrease engagement, but overall may be a better idea.
<li> Please be polite and kind to everyone. I am sure we will all make mistakes, and grace is something all of us will need.
</ul>


<p>
<b> Academic Integrity / Honor Code </b><br>
<br>

Algorithms are tough, but fun. And it is even more fun when one works with a friend. <b> I highly recommend forming study groups </b> and watch the videos together, go over notes together, pore over practice problem + solutions together.
And bang heads on the weekly problem set together. This is not only allowed, I highly encourage it. However, the final solution you write, <b> must be your own.</b> <br> <br>

For coding assignments and drills, I recommend <b>working on your own</b>. This will make you understand the concepts better, and make you all better coders.
Only if stuck, contact the teaching personnel or your friend. For instance, if your code is not working, this is the perfect thing to share your screen with a TA and ask them what's wrong.
Or asking your friend, <i>"Hey, how does one convert a string to an integer in Python?"</i> Perfectly OK. But there is a line here which you must make sure you don't cross. <br><br>

<font color="red"> <b> This is important </b> : </font> For <b>all</b> your submissions, you <b> must </b> provide a credit statment even if you have worked alone (in which case, state "Worked alone").
Please write the names of all you have worked with. If this set is empty say so. Not writing a credit statement <b> can give you a zero </b>.
I know many solutions are written at the last minute; spend the first 10 seconds of that minute to 
cite people who help you. Good habit. <br> <br>

Finally, some <b> possible honor principle violations </b> to be aware of in this online course offering.
<ul>
<li>Sharing the same overleaf, github, replit, etc website for sharing any part of the (drill, coding, weekly pset) assignments. You simply cannot share this. </li>
<li> Obtaining answers on the Web, and then simply copy-and-pasting. Especially pertains to coding assignments. </li>
</ul>
I stress here that since you all will be "socially distant", you will probably using tools like above to brainstorm, etc. 
For instance, you may zoom with a classmate about a pset, and then you may obtain (say in a recorded session) some written material from your friend about a weekly pset.
You <b>must not</b> use it as is; everything you write must be your own words. <br><br>

Simply put, there is a line, and you would know if you are crossing it. Just don't. 
Dartmouth's Academic Honor Principle applies to this course. Please be sure to read the principle, which you can 
find <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/judicialaffairs/honor/"> here </a>.
Please ask me if you have any questions about the honor code as it applies to CS 31. Please, please don't be in a situation where you and I need to go through unpleasantries. <br>
