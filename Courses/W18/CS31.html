<b> Course Description and Goals: </b> <br>
Algorithms are step-by-step instructions for a computation problem. 
Although this sounds like a cooking recipe, good algorithms is what makes the modern world run.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  In this course, we will study algorithms rigorously. At the end of the course, the student should be able to 
<u>design</u> algorithms for problems, <u>reason</u> about these algorithms, and <u>communicate</u> the algorithm and its analysis.


<p><b> Background Assumed: </b><br>
Students should have basic knowledge about programming <i> and </i> should be able to read and write mathematical proofs.  
If you have taken CS 1, CS 10, CS 30 or equivalents, you should be fine. A problem set 0 will be given out on first day of class which should allow you to 
test compatibility.

<h2> Problem Sets </h2>
Weekly problems sets which will be due on Thursdays, 11:59pm. All submissions must be done via Canvas.
Problem Sets are posted on Canvas too.
<ul>
<li> <a href="ps/ps0.pdf"> Problem Set 0</a>: Due by Jan 11th, 11:59pm</li>
</ul>
<hr><hr>


<a name="policies"></a>
<h2> Policies  </h2>
<p><b> Evaluation </b> <br>
<ul>
<li> Eight Problem Sets : 42 </li>
<li> Midterm : 20 </li>
<li> Endterm : 35 </li>
<li> Participation : 3 </li>
</ul>
Both Midterm and Endterm will be an in-class examination with no cheat sheets allowed. 
Some problems of the exam may be released in advance. 


<p><b> Grading Scheme </b> <br>
Although the final grades will be fit to a curve, the following gives some ``guaranteed grades''
<ul>
<li> > 96 : A </li>
<li> > 92 : at least A- </li>
<li> > 80 : at least B </li>
<li> > 65 : at least C </li>
</ul>


<p>
<b> Lectures, X-hours, Attendence Policy</b><br>
I will be using almost all the X-hours and it is <u> extremely critical </u> you keep yourself free for these hours. 

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Algorithms is not a spectator sport, and you must participate to learn. Ask and Answer questions both in class and Piazza.
I have reserved 3 points for this activity which are at my discretion.

<p>
<b> Grading Scheme for Problems</b> <br>
We will follow Amit Chakrabarti's detailed <a href="https://ssl.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac/Teach/CS49-Winter17/admindetails.html#grading"> grading scheme </a>.
Every problem will be worth 7 points which you get if you are complete, correct, and concise. 
Note: presentation is as important as the ideas.



<p>
<b> Regrading Policy</b><br>
If there is a totalling error, please see any of the TAs and they will fix it rightaway. <br>
On the other hand, if you feel that the grader has not graded accurately then you should clearly write down which problem <u> and </u> your reason why you think the grading is 
incorrect, staple it with your answer-sheet and hand it to the Head TA during his or her office hour <br>
If even after this you feel unsatisfied, then you can email the instructor for a <u> full regrade </u>.
I will look at the entire problem set and re-grade it completely.

<p>
<b> Late Exercises and Problem Sets</b><br>
Problem Sets are submitted via Canvas. Each student has <u> two late days </u> available. Note that even a minute late in canvas is a day late.
Any late submissions after the two late days won't be considered.


<p>
<b> No Laptop / No Phone Policy </b><br>
We have a no-laptop/no-phone policy in class to minimize distractions and encourage participation.
We have a no-laptop/no-phone/no note-taking policy during office hours.

<p>
<b> Academic Integrity / Honor Code </b><br>
<u> All work submitted for credit must be your own.</u> <br>
You may discuss the homework problem sets with your classmates (taking the course with you), the TAs, and the instructor. No one else. 
You are also not allowed to give away solutions to your classmates.
Clarification questions about problems should be asked on Piazza. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
At the beginning of each problem you must write who you discussed with, and what way did the person help you or you help them. This is important.
If you did not talk with anyone about any of the problems, mention this at the beginning of the homework.
Any written sources used (apart from the text, your lecture notes and any homework solutions that I distribute) must also be acknowledged; 
however, you may not consult any solutions on the Internet or from previous years' assignments, whether they are student- or faculty-generated. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Dartmouth's Academic Honor Principle applies to this course. Please be sure to read the principle, which you can find <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/judicialaffairs/honor/"> here </a>.
Please ask me if you have any questions about the honor code as it applies to CS 31. Better safe than sorry!
