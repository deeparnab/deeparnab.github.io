<b> Course Description and Goals: </b> <br>
Algorithms are step-by-step instructions for a computation problem. 
Although this sounds like a cooking recipe, good algorithms is what makes the modern world run.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  In this course, we will study algorithms rigorously. At the end of the course, the student should be able to 
<u>design</u> algorithms for problems, <u>reason</u> about these algorithms, and <u>communicate</u> the algorithm and its analysis.


<p><b> Background Assumed: </b><br>
Students should have basic knowledge about programming <i> and </i> should be able to read and write mathematical proofs.  
If you have taken CS 1, CS 10, CS 30 or equivalents, you should be fine. In case you haven't, then see 
<a href="./ps/ps0.pdf"> this </a>.<hr> 
<br>
<b> Class Times:</b> 10A (TR: 10:10am - 12noon), X-hours (W: 3:30pm - 4:20pm) <br>

<h2> Policies  </h2>

<p>
<b> Lectures, X-hours, Attendence Policy</b><br>
Attend <b> all </b> classes. Posted slides are for review not first-view,
and I don't make any guarantee that they contain everything I say in class.
I will be using many of the X-hours and it is <u> extremely critical </u> you keep yourself free for these hours. 





<p>
<b> Regrading Policy</b><br>
If there is a totalling error, please see any of the TAs and they will fix it rightaway. <br>
On the other hand, if you feel that the grader has not graded accurately then you should clearly write down which problem <u> and </u> your reason why you think the grading is 
incorrect, staple it with your answer-sheet and hand it to the Head TA during his or her office hour <br>
If even after this you feel unsatisfied, then you can email the instructor for a <u> full regrade </u>.
I will look at the entire problem set and re-grade it completely.



<p>
<b> Late Exercises and Problem Sets</b><br>
Problem Sets are submitted via Canvas. Each student has a <u> total of two late days </u> available. 
Note that even a minute late in canvas is a day late. 
I will be <b> extremely strict </b> on this: any late submissions after the two late days will be straight given a zero.
No excuses shall be entertained. <b> Drill Problem Sets</b> have no late days available.


<p>
<b> Laptops and Phone Policy </b><br>
We encourage students not to use devices in class. If they have to, then they need to seat themselves on the fringes of the classroom 
so as to not distract other students. <br>
During office hours, there are <b>no devices and no notes allowed</b>. Period. If you need to discuss a problem set, then please have it printed out.
Please don't make me repeat these policies aloud in class and office hours.



<p>
<b> Academic Integrity / Honor Code </b><br>
<u> All work submitted for credit must be your own.</u> 
This means what you put down on paper for submission cannot be in any way copied from a black/white board, a computer screen, or even your notes from class.
<br>

You <b> cannot </b> discuss the drill problem sets with anyone. 
You may discuss the problem sets with your classmates (taking the course with you), the TAs, and the instructor. No one else. 
You are also not allowed to give away solutions to your classmates.
Clarification questions about problems should be asked on Piazza. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
At the beginning of each problem you must write who you discussed with, and what way did the person help you or you help them. This is important.
If you did not talk with anyone about any of the problems, mention this at the beginning of the homework.
Any written sources used (apart from the text, your lecture notes and any homework solutions that I distribute) must also be acknowledged; 
however, you may not consult any solutions on the Internet or from previous years' assignments, whether they are student- or faculty-generated. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Dartmouth's Academic Honor Principle applies to this course. Please be sure to read the principle, which you can find <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/judicialaffairs/honor/"> here </a>.
Please ask me if you have any questions about the honor code as it applies to CS 31. Better safe than sorry!
