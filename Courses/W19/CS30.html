<b> Course Description and Goals: </b> <br>
Discrete Mathematics is what one needs to talk about most problems in computer science which involves discrete objects such as bits, integers, files in a directory, 
nodes in a network, etc. At the end of this course, students will be comfortable understanding and using this language. 
The other main objective is to read, write, and understand <i> rigorous mathematical proofs </i> of propositions involving these discrete objects.
Proofs are important not only to prove correctness of, say, your code, but also important to <i> design </i> new algorithms as well. 
Most importantly, all of these are a lot of fun!


<p><b> Background Assumed: </b><br>
Students should have basic knowledge about programming <i> and </i> should have some familiarity with basic math.
You should know the concepts given <a href="./basics.pdf"> here </a>.
If you have taken CS 1 and MATH 3 or equivalents, you should be fine. Talk to the instructor if you have any questions about prerequisites.

<b> Text Book (Strongly Recommended): </b> <br>
David Liben-Nowell, <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yafoe4yn"> Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science.  </a> There is an e-version which is less expensive.
I will also post some reading materials online before class. At times, I will expect you to <b> read before you come </b> to class.

<p><b> Evaluation </b> <br>
<ul>
<li> Drill Exercises: 30% </li>
<li> Problem Sets : 30% </li>
<li> Midterm : 14% </li>
<li> Final : 24% </li>
<li> Participation : 2% </li>
</ul>
After <b> almost every </b> class there will be a drill exercise of 1 or 2 problems with a 36 hour deadline.
There will be weekly problem sets. There will be two Midterms and one Final Examination which are in-class and closed-book.

<!--
<p> <b> Tentative Topics Covered: </b> Big Oh Notation, Divide and Conquer Algorithms, Randomized Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, 
Graph Traversal, Shortest Path, Maximum Flow Problems, Matching. <br>
 Detailed schedule will be available when the class starts. -->

<h2> Tentative Weekly Schedule </h2> 

Anything in light grey is tentative which will (hopefully) become black as the classes occur. The tentative schedule breaks the quarter into roughly 8 modules, and will 
be covering one module per week. 
As seen below, we will be utilizing our X-hours a lot. If some notes links aren't working, they can be found in the "Files" section of Canvas.

<h2> Policies  </h2>

<p>
<b> Lectures, X-hours, Attendence Policy, and Notes</b><br>
Attend <b> all </b> classes including X-hours, of which I may use all of.
I will post some notes which may contain more than what is covered. 



<p>
<b> Regrading Policy</b><br>
If there is a totalling error, please see any of the TAs and they will fix it rightaway. <br>
On the other hand, if you feel that the grader has not graded accurately then you should clearly write down which problem <u> and </u> your reason 
why you think the grading is 
incorrect, staple it with your answer-sheet and hand it to the Head TA during his or her office hour <br>
If even after this you feel unsatisfied, then you can email the instructor for a <u> full regrade </u>.
I will look at the entire problem set and re-grade it completely.



<p>
<b> Late Exercises and Problem Sets</b><br>
Problem Sets are submitted via Canvas. Each student has a <u> total of two late days </u> available. 
Note that even a minute late in canvas is a day late. 
I will be <b> extremely strict </b> on this: any late submissions after the two late days will be straight given a zero.
No excuses shall be entertained. <b> Drill Problem Sets</b> have no late days available; but there will be some slack on how many drills you need to do.


<p>
<b> Laptops and Phone Policy </b><br>
We encourage students not to use devices in class. If they have to, then they need to seat themselves on the fringes of the classroom 
so as to not distract other students. <br>



<p>
<b> Academic Integrity / Honor Code </b><br>
<u> All work submitted for credit must be your own.</u> 
This means what you put down on paper for submission cannot be in any way copied from a black/white board, a computer screen, or even your notes from class.
<br>

You <b> cannot </b> discuss the drill problem sets with anyone. 
You may discuss the problem sets with your classmates (taking the course with you), the TAs, and the instructor. No one else. 
You are also not allowed to give away solutions to your classmates.
Clarification questions about problems should be asked on Piazza. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
At the beginning of each problem you must write who you discussed with, and what way did the person help you or you help them. This is important.
If you did not talk with anyone about any of the problems, mention this at the beginning of the homework.
Any written sources used (apart from the text, your lecture notes and any homework solutions that I distribute) must also be acknowledged; 
however, you may not consult any solutions on the Internet or from previous years' assignments, whether they are student- or faculty-generated. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
Dartmouth's Academic Honor Principle applies to this course. Please be sure to read the principle, which you can find <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/judicialaffairs/honor/"> here </a>.
Please ask me if you have any questions about the honor code as it applies to CS 30. Better safe than sorry!
