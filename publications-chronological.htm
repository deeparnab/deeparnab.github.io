	<p> Submodular functions on an n-element universe can be minimized in polynomial time. The best known algorithms make O(n<sup>3</sup>) queries or O(n<sup>2</sup> polylog M) queries, where M is the

<b> Property Testing on Product Distributions: Optimal Testers for Bounded Derivative Properties. </b>

<div id="product" class="abs" style="display:none"> <p>
In property testing, the concept of distance is crucial and is often defined using the Hamming distance between objects. For instance, a function's distance to monotonicity 
is often defined to be the fraction of domain points at which it needs to be modified to make it monotone. How does the situation change when the underlying distribution used to measure
the distance is not uniform. In this paper, we look at arbitrarty <b> product </b> distributions, and essentially show the quality of a monotonicity tester is worst for the uniform distribution.
More precisely, we prove that the query complexity is essentially the entropy (but not quite) of the product distribution by exhibiting simple testers and not-so-simple lower bounds.
Our results hold for a general class of properties which we call bouned derivative properties.

	<div id="wolfe" class="abs" style="display:none"><p>
	In 1976, Wolfe proposed an algorithm to find the minimum Euclideam norm point in a polytope. He proved finite convergence of his algorithm, although the known running time is exponential in the
	number of vertices of the polytope. In 1980, Fujishige observed that Wolfe's minimum norm point algorithm can be used to minimize submodular functions by running it on the function's base polytope.
	In practice, it has been observed that this Fujishige-Wolfe minimum norm point algorithm works decently well, although, no theoretical guarantee (apart from Wolfe's) was known. 
	In this paper, we make some progress. We prove that Wolfe's algorithm has 1/t convergence, in that, in O(t) iterations it returns a t-approximate solution. Along with a robust version of Fujishige's
	theorem regarding submodular functions, this implies a <i> pseudopolynomial time</i> for submodular minimization.

	In an allocation setting where preferences of agents are orders over outcomes rather than cardinal numbers for each preference, the notion of 
	social welfare is not well defined or agreed upon. Furthermore, when mechanisms are randomized, the concept of truthfulness comes into question. In this paper,
	wearing our TCS hats, we propose a notion of welfare called rank approximation. A mechanism has c-rank approximation if for all i between 1 and n, 
	the number of agents getting their top i choices
	is within c-factor of the allocation tailored to maximize the number of agents getting their top i choices.
	We also propose a notion of truthfulness, called lex-truthfulness, in randomized ordinal mechanisms. This notion is nicely sandwiched between two notions studied in the literature.
	Equipped with these notions, we define matching market mechanisms which are lex-truthful and have optimal rank approximation.

Finally, we design a heuristic for budget smoothing which performs considerably better than existing benchmark heuristics.
