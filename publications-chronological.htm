		Given an unknown non-negative N-dimensional vector x, suppose you could "measure" it using a linear measurement, that is, obtain a*x for any N-dimensional query vector a.
		How many queries do you need to <b>deterministically</b> return one element from x's support? The answer is log N, using binary search. However, binary search is an adaptive algorithm which takes log N
		rounds of queries. What is the answer if you had only 2 rounds allowed? A moment's thought will show you how to do this in sqrt(N) queries per round. In this paper we prove this is tight. 
		We also look at the related and more general question of finding a spanning tree in a graph using "cut-queries" or "independent set" queries, and obtain rounds-versus-query trade-offs.

<b> Revisiting Priority k-Center: Fairness and Outliers </b>
	<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03337">[pdf]</a>
	<a href="javascript:toggle('robpriokcen')"> [abs] </a> <br>
	with Tanvi Bajpai, Chandra Chekuri, and Maryam Negahbani. <br>
	In <i> Proc. ICALP 2021. </i>
	<div id="robpriokcen" class="abs" style="display:none"> 
	<p> 
	In the usual k-center problem, one wants to open k-centers so that the maximum distance of a point to an open center is minimized. However, not all points may be equal, and 
	one could ask the "priority" version where the distance of a point is multiplied by their priority, and the maximum of this prioritized distance is to be minimized. Indeed, this 
	also has a 2-approximation algorithm which is tight even for the vanilla k-center problem, and was known since 1987.

	In this paper we look at the problem in the presence of outliers, that is, when the maximum can be taken over a fraction of the clients. The vanilla k-center with outliers has a 2-approximation.
	We give a 9-approximation for the priority k-center with outliers. Our framework also is able to handle more general constraints (knapsack and matroid) on the opened centers (though we take a hit
	in the approximation factor in the knapsack case). We show that better than 3-approximation is not possible, but bridging the gap between 3 and 9 may need another idea.

	<p> 
	In an older paper with Prachi Goyal and Ravishankar Krishnaswamy [ICALP 2016, TALG 2020], we had introduced the non-uniform k-center problem which generalizes the k-center with outliers problem.
	We are given k possibly different radii balls, and we have to figure out how to place them on a metric space such that the unions of dilated versions of these cover the whole metric space. 
	We want to make the dilation as small as possible. We proved that if the number of types is part of input, no constant factor approximation is possible. However, I have felt (and still feel)
	for constantly many types, there should be a O(1) approximation. And indeed, that paper we could give for 2-types of radii.
	
	We make "epsilon progress" in this paper. We show that the 2-types of radii *with outliers* has a 10-approximation. The problem of constantly many types is still open.

<b> Better and Simpler Error Analysis of the Sinkhorn-Knopp Algorithm for Matrix Scaling</b>

	<div id="sinkhorn" class="abs" style="display:none"> 
	<p> 
	Given a non-negative matrix, can we multiply the rows and columns by scalars so that the scaled matrix has prescribed row and columns sums?
    The Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm is a simple iterative procedure which first scales all the rows and then scales all the columns, and repeats this getting closer 
	to the desired matrix. Although simple and known for around 80 years, the analysis of the procedure is still incomplete. 
	In this paper, we give a better and simpler error analysis of this algorithm. 
	A key tool is a new inequality connecting KL-divergence between two distributions and their ell_2 norms.

<b> Domain Reduction for Monotonicity Testing: A o(d) Tester for Boolean Functions in d-Dimensions</b>

In property testing, the concept of distance is crucial and is often defined using the Hamming distance between objects. For instance, a function's distance to monotonicity 
is often defined to be the fraction of domain points at which it needs to be modified to make it monotone. How does the situation change when the underlying distribution used to measure
the distance is not uniform. In this paper, we look at arbitrarty <b> product </b> distributions, and essentially show the quality of a monotonicity tester is worst for the uniform distribution.
More precisely, we prove that the query complexity is essentially the entropy (but not quite) of the product distribution by exhibiting simple testers and not-so-simple lower bounds.
Our results hold for a general class of properties which we call bouned derivative properties.

In a breakthrough in 2011, Svensson <a href="http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/110851201"> showed </a> that the value of the optimum makespan can be <i> estimated </i> 
up to a factor of 1.95, in the restricted assignment setting. However, a polynomial time algorithm to obtain a schedule achieving the corresponding makespan is as of yet not known.
In this paper, we look at a special case of restricted assignment problem where jobs are of two sizes - 1 or eps. We demonstrate a polynomial time (2 - delta) approximation
for some constant delta > 0 which doesn't depend on epsilon.

	<div id="wolfe" class="abs" style="display:none"><p>
	In 1976, Wolfe proposed an algorithm to find the minimum Euclideam norm point in a polytope. He proved finite convergence of his algorithm, although the known running time is exponential in the
	number of vertices of the polytope. In 1980, Fujishige observed that Wolfe's minimum norm point algorithm can be used to minimize submodular functions by running it on the function's base polytope.
	In practice, it has been observed that this Fujishige-Wolfe minimum norm point algorithm works decently well, although, no theoretical guarantee (apart from Wolfe's) was known. 
	In this paper, we make some progress. We prove that Wolfe's algorithm has 1/t convergence, in that, in O(t) iterations it returns a t-approximate solution. Along with a robust version of Fujishige's
	theorem regarding submodular functions, this implies a <i> pseudopolynomial time</i> for submodular minimization.

	<div id="WMATIMDWOP" class="abs" style="display:none"><p>
	In an allocation setting where preferences of agents are orders over outcomes rather than cardinal numbers for each preference, the notion of 
	social welfare is not well defined or agreed upon. Furthermore, when mechanisms are randomized, the concept of truthfulness comes into question. In this paper,
	wearing our TCS hats, we propose a notion of welfare called rank approximation. A mechanism has c-rank approximation if for all i between 1 and n, 
	the number of agents getting their top i choices
	is within c-factor of the allocation tailored to maximize the number of agents getting their top i choices.
	We also propose a notion of truthfulness, called lex-truthfulness, in randomized ordinal mechanisms. This notion is nicely sandwiched between two notions studied in the literature.
	Equipped with these notions, we define matching market mechanisms which are lex-truthful and have optimal rank approximation.

       <p>
       In Internet ad auctions, the search engine often has to "throttle" budget constrained advertisers to spread their expenditure equally across a specified time period.
       We ask how should this `budget-smoothing' be done? We put on our game theoretic hats and propose a notion of regret-free smoothing policies. We show these always exist, and for single slot auctions can be found in polynomial time via an algorithm which smells of Gale-Shapley's deferred acceptance algorithm.
Finally, we design a heuristic for budget smoothing which performs considerably better than existing benchmark heuristics.

is a 0,1 matrix, can one say anything about the "capacitated" version of the IP where each column of A is multiplied by an arbitrary positive integer? That is, is there a relation between a 
covering problem (say covering a line using intervals) with a version where each element has a demand and each set has a supply. We answer a "conditional" yes: we define a related 
0,1-optimization problem called the <i> priority</i> version, and if the priority version has integrality gap b, the capacitated version has an O(a+b) algorithm.
